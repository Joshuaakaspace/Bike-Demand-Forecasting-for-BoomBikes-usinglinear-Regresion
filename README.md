# Bike Demand Forecasting for BoomBikes using linear Regression
>BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, aimed to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after the COVID-19 quarantine situation ends across the nation. The main goal was to develop a model that predicts the demand for shared bikes based on various environmental and seasonal settings. The dataset used in this project consists of daily bike rental data spanning two years.

## Conclusions
From the final Linear Regression Model, I concluded the following:

- The actual temperature in Celsius ('temp') is the most important feature of predicting bike rentals.
- The year ('yr') is the second most important feature, indicating that the demand for shared bikes has increased from 2018 to 2019.
- The feeling of temperature in Celsius ('atemp') is the third most important feature.
