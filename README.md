BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, aimed to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after the COVID-19 quarantine situation ends across the nation. The main goal was to develop a model that predicts the demand for shared bikes based on various environmental and seasonal settings. The dataset used in this project consists of daily bike rental data spanning two years.

Conclusions
From the final Linear Regression Model, I concluded the following:

The actual temperature in Celsius ('temp') is the most important feature predicting bike rentals.
The year ('yr') is the second most important feature, indicating that the demand for shared bikes has increased from 2018 to 2019.
The feeling temperature in Celsius ('atemp') is the third most important feature.

Further Enhancements:
Introducing new features like the day of the month and the interaction between temperature and working day, and using a Random Forest Regressor improved the model's R-squared score on the test set to approximately 0.912.
